# TDD

## Discipline
* Write a test.
* Make the compiler pass.
* Run the test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful.
* Write enough code to make the test pass.
* Refactor.

## TDD process and why the steps are important
* _Write a failing test and see_ it fail, so we know we have
written a _relevant test_ for our requirements and seen it produces an _easy to 
to understand description of failure_.
*  Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so know we have working
software.
* Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure 
we have well-crafted code that is easy to refactor with
